# DSLocationCenter
CLLocationManager helper with request based API

The main idea of this tool is to provide convenient API for CLLocationManager, 
buy letting developer set desired properties for geo request without managing all those delegate calls.

It is an old code and by the moment I decided to share it, I found several other similar projects on Github. So I don't solve a real problem with this...

It is documented in code and I provided demo if you wonder how to use it.
